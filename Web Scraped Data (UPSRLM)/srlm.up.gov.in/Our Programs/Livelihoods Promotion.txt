NRLM envisages that the poor move gradually on the continuum from consumption → debt swapping → enhancement of existing livelihoods → diversification. Major focus of NRLM is to stabilize and promote existing livelihoods portfolio of the poor, in farm and in non-farm sectors. NRLM would look at the entire portfolio of livelihoods of each household and facilitate support for the activities at the individual/household level, or in a collective, or at both levels. As agriculture is the mainstay livelihoods activity for a large proportion of the rural poor, NRLM will lay special focus on sustainable agriculture and allied activities like animal husbandry, non-timber forest production and fisheries.

The NRLM Livelihoods Promotion are:
NRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and to support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements and public services, diversified risk and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.
