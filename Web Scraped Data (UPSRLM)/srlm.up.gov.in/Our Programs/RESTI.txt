Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs)
Introduction

Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) are established and managed by leading banks with the active support of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Government of India, and State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs).

These are dedicated training institutions that provide skill development programs to unemployed rural youth, particularly those below the poverty line, and periodic skill up gradation to keep them abreast of latest technologies helping them achieve self-employment and sustainable livelihoods. Once trained appropriately, the youth will launch profitable micro-enterprises and enhance their own standards of living and thereby contribute to the overall national economy. RSETIs are promoted and managed by banks with active cooperation from state governments. Each RSETI should offer 30 to 40 Skill Development Programmes in a financial year in various avenues. All the programmes are of short duration ranging preferably from 1 to 6 weeks. The trainees are provided intensive short-term residential self-employment training programmes with free food and accommodation.

After training escorts services are provided for at least for two years soon to ensure sustainability of micro enterprise trainees.

Identification of financial needs (working capital, equipment, raw materials, etc.)
Identification of Suitable Credit Schemes
Depending on the type of business and financial requirement, trainees are linked to various government-supported or bank-financed schemes, such as:

MUDRA Loan (Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana - PMMY)
Start-up India Scheme
Stand-up India Scheme (for SC/ST/Women Entrepreneurs)
